Ubuntu Russian Phonetic Keyboard on OSX
===========

Why?  
----

I use OSX and Ubuntu interchangeably, I do type in Russian sometimes, I do it on standard US keyboards, I want the keys to be exactly on the same place.

What?
-----

This layout is based on Ubuntu keyboard *Russian (phonetic Winkeys)*.

Where?
------

Place the `Russian-Phonetic-Linux.keylayout` file into `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`

```
cp Russian-Phonetic-Linux.keylayout ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
```

and logout and login back.  Then go to System Preferences->Keyboard->Input Sources
and checkmark input source called `Russian-Phonetic-Linux_`.

How?
